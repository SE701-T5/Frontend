# Frontend
## What does this project do?
This is the frontend repository for our student forum application. This means the codebase will contain only React components and API calls to the backend server repo. If you want to contribute to the backend of our student forum, please request access to the "Backend" repo in the organisation if you dont have read access already.

The frontend will be hooked to Netlify for continuous deployment on the main branch. This also means that all pull requests made will have a nice preview of the changes by viewing the Netlify link.
